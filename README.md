What is  Vertical Federated Learning?
Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework that can effectively help multiple organizations use their own data to use machine learning for joint modeling while meeting the requirements of data privacy protection. FL aims to achieve learning goals by using the intermediate results of transmission, so as to ensure that the original data of the organization is stored locally without any exchange or transmission. Vertical federated learning has different feature distributions according to the data of participating institutions, and is usually divided into horizontal federated learning (Horizontal FL, HFL) and vertical federated learning (Vertical FL, VFL). Among them, VFL is suitable for scenarios where institutions have the same sample space but different feature spaces. In recent years, VFL has been widely used in fields such as medical health, risk assessment and advertising recommendations.
